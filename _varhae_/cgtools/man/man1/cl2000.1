.SH DESCRIPTION
The compiler is an optimizing C/C++ compiler that accepts C++ as well as American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard C source code and produces target specific object code.  This compiler builds object code directly from your C++ program source.  There is no intermediate C version of the program.

The 
.B Optimizing C Compiler User's Guide
discusses the characteristics and limitations of this C/C++ compiler, as well as the languages, features and keywords supported.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are accepted by this tool:
.SS Control Options:
.SS
.TP
-c
Disable linking, overriding -z (if used).
.TP
-h
Show usage information.  When followed by another option or a phrase display that option's detailed information, or search for options related to that phrase.
.TP
-n
Compile only; do not assemble
.TP
-z[=arguments]
After compiling all the source files, perform a link and pass all the options following this option to the linker.
.SS Symbolic Debug Options:
.SS
.TP
-g
Enable full symbolic DWARF debugging in the generated object or out file. [Same as -gw]
.TP
-gp
Adds the necessary debug directives to the object file which are needed by the profiler to allow function level profiling with minimal impact on optimization (if optimization is enabled). Using -g may hinder some optimizations to ensure that debuggability is maintained, while this option will not hinder optimization.

You will still be able to set breakpoints and profile on function-level boundaries, but you will not be able to single-step through code as with full debug ability.
.TP
-gt
Enable full symbolic COFF debugging in the generated object or out file (DEPRECATED).
.TP
-gw
Enable full symbolic DWARF debugging in the generated object or out file. [Same as -g]
.TP
--symdebug:none
Disable debug and suppress all symbolic debug information from being included in the generated object or out file.
.TP
--symdebug:skeletal
Enable symbolic debug information for program analysis. (default)

.SS Parser Preprocessing Options:
.SS
.TP
-ppa
This option instructs the compiler to additionally continue compilation of the source file (rather than exiting) after generating a pre-processing .pp output file such as those generated by -ppd (dependencies) -ppi (included files), or -ppm (macros).

.TP
-ppm[=filename]
Generate a list of predefined and user defined macros for the source file into the file <filename>.pp and then exit.  Optionally, name the output file. The output will include only those files directly included by the source file.   Also see the -ppa option to continue compilation after generating the macro list (similar to gcc).
.TP
-ppo
Only preprocess the source file(s) and then stop.
.SS Predefined Symbols Options:
.SS

--cla_support[=cla0]
This option can be used to specify how CLA support is provided.

This switch also disables optimizations that cannot be handled by the power-profiler.

.SS
.TP
-ma
Assume called funcs create hidden aliases (rare)

.TP
-op=0-3
Specify assumptions to make about function calls when optimizing.

Level 0 (-op0) indicates that the module has functions that are called from other modules.

Level 1 (-op1) indicates that the module does not have functions that are called by other modules but has global variables that are modified in other modules.

Level 2 (-op2) indicates that the module does not have functions that are called or globals that are modified by other modules.

Level 3 (-op3) indicates that the module has functions that are called by other modules but does not have globals that are modified by other modules.
.TP
-os
Generate optimized source interlisted assembly

Pass caller's name or address to exit hook
.SS Feedback Options:
.SS
.TP
--analyze=callgraph,codecov
Generate analysis information about code coverage or call graph information in the form of CSV files.  This information can then be read and interpreted by other tools.  For example, the cache layout tool, clt6x, can be used to interpret the call graph information and produce a preferred function order that can be incorporated into the application link.  The compiler can only generate one kind of analysis information for a given invocation of the compiler.
.TP
--analyze_only
Generate analysis only; do not continue compilation. This option is used in combination with the --analyze option to instruct the compiler to halt the compilation after it has completed the generation of analysis information requested in the --analyze option.
.TP
--gen_profile_info
Instrument the object code that is generated for a compilation with path profiling information.  The compiler will annotate the code that is generated for an application so that, when executed, the application can generate information about which code paths were executed and how often.  This profile data can then be used by subsequent compiles to analyze code coverage or call graph information to assist with subsequent development.
.TP
--use_profile_info[=filelist]
This option is used in combination with the --analyze option to generate analysis information about code coverage or call graph information in the form of CSV files.  This information can then be read and interpreted by other tools.  For example, the cache layout tool, clt6x, can be used to interpret the call graph information and produce a preferred function order that can be incorporated into the application link.  The compiler can only generate one kind of analysis information for a given invocation of the compiler.
.SS Library Function Assumptions Options:
.SS
.TP
-ol0
File redefines an RTS library function.
.TP
-ol1
File contains an RTS library function.
.TP
-ol2
File does not define any RTS library func (def.)
.TP
--printf_support=full,minimal,nofloat
Printf/sprintf functions use a common low level routine, _printfi which processes a given printf format string.  The full version of _printfi provides formatting capabalities that are not required in typical embedded applications. To address this the C runtime library also includes two limited of versions of _printfi that provide a useful subset of the formatting features specified by C library standard.

One version excludes support for printing floating values. All format specifiers except for %f, %g, %G, %e, or %E are supported. To specify this version use the option '--printf_support=nofloat' when linking.

The other version only supports printing of integer, char, or string values without width or precision flags.  Only %%, %d, %o, %c, %s and %x are supported.  To specify this version use the option '--printf_support=minimal' when linking.

--flash_prefetch_warn
Assembler will issue a warning if a program data access instruction follows within 8 words of a BF/SBF instruction.  As outlined in TMS320C281X/TMS320F281X DSP Silicon Errata document SPRZ193K, page 7, section titled 'Memory: Flash and OTP Prefetch Buffer Overflow' the flash prefetch buffer may overflow if this instruction sequence is executed from flash or OTP with the flash prefetch buffer enabled. Whether or not an overflow actually occurs depends on the instruction sequence, flash wait states and CPU pipeline stall. If an overflow occurs it will result in execution of invalid opcodes. Instructions that use program memory addressing include MAC/XMAC, DMAC/XMACD, QMACL, IMACL, PREAD/XPREAD, and PWRITE/XPWRITE
